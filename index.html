        </p>
        <p>
            A 3d engine created using the 2d canvas context. 
            Uses a lot of trigonometry and geometry to render a 3d environment onto a 2d cartesian plane. 
            Originally started out as a project to do in my free time for fun but later the opportunity arose to 
            use it as a continuous assessment handup for a college web development project.
        </p>
        <p>
            It originally contained serverside programming to implement database functionality such as a login system, leaderboards for times, 
            information on the randomly generated mazes etc. but since losing access to the UCC database these features have been temporarily removed.

            Note: You may need to activate Chrome experimental features for it to display as the CSS is implemeted using the grid system.

        <p>
            Experimenting with environmental mechanics to introduce to my 3d engine. This particular one is the portal mechanics from the popular puzzle game series "Portal". 
            Chose this as it would be quite challenging from a geometry point of view. This is a work in progress.

        </p>
        <p>
            A neural network that evolves using the NEAT algorithm in order to learn how to navigate environments rendered in my 3d engine.
        </p>
        <p>
            This is a work in progress.
